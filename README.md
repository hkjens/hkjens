# Hello I'm Jens Kleinhout ðŸ‘‹

## About my work

I always followed a certain curiosity to guide my professional life, a desire to experience, learn, know and to create things. My education as electrical engineer at TU/e Eindhoven helped me to expand my possibilities. To this day, I love to think about how things can be done better and IT is a practical tool for that in our digital era.

### Gamification and serious mini-games

Gamification and building serious mini-games are some of my interests. Besides that it's very fun to work on, they are tools that I use to achieve objectives. There is a child in us all, we can use that to build better software.

## HKdigital

I work in a small development team at [HKdigital](https://hkdigital.nl) in a small Dutch town called Ophemert ([where?](https://www.google.com/maps/place/HKdigital/@51.8461705,5.3736168,2397m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x47c6f70d46cc4da5:0xc8f4eff9ccc17a59!8m2!3d51.8467495!4d5.3790371)).

### Partnerships
Together with [HKmobile](https://hkmobile.nl) and [HKsimulatoren](https://hksimulatoren.nl) we offer unique and innovative products and solutions to schools, companies, industry associations and event management organizations.

Together with [De Verschilmakerij](https://www.deverschilmakerij.nl/) we deliver gamified educational programs to inspire children and adults to make a difference and to create a healthy environment and a circular economy together.

### Open Source

I will publish as much code as possible via public repositories of HKdigital. 

Getting private code in good shape, so the community can profit from it, is an ongoing work in progress. Please contact me if you want to join us by contributing in hours of work, financially or some other way.
