# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## My company

I'm currently working at [HKdigital](https://hkdigital.nl) in a small Dutch town called Ophemert ([where?](https://www.google.com/maps/place/HKdigital/@51.8461705,5.3736168,2397m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x47c6f70d46cc4da5:0xc8f4eff9ccc17a59!8m2!3d51.8467495!4d5.3790371)).

HKdigital is close friends with [HKmobile](https://hkmobile.nl) and [HKsimulatoren](https://hksimulatoren.nl).

## My work

I always followed a certain curiosity to guide my professional life, a desire to experience, learn, know and to create things.
My education as electrical engineer at TU/e Eindhoven helped me to expand my possibilities.
To this day, I love to think about how things can be done better and IT is a practical tool for that in our digital era.

### Gamification

Gamification is one of my interests. Like IT, it is a tool to archieve something. People enjoy working with gamified software.
And imagine that the software is not only on your screen, but actually runs an interactive environment around you? And how about putting that on wheels?

## My code

### Life is too short for private code

Like most other developers, I had to choose between keeping code private or not.
I've decided to start sharing code, I feel that's the best thing to do in the long run.

Most code will be published as public repositories of HKdigital. 

Getting private code in shape, so the community can profit from it, is an ongoing work in progress. Please contact me if you want to join me by contributing in hours of work, financially or some other way.

# Support cancer research

If you like my work and would like to motivate me to continue doing these things, please donate some money for cancer research.
Do it for a better future of others and yourself!

Currently I'm participating with team HKmobile in Alpe d'HuZes 2022:

Alpe d'HuZes is a unique sporting event where as much money as possible is raised for cancer research and for improving the quality of life of people with cancer. On a single day, 5000 participants will bike, hike or run the Alpe d'Huez. Attempting a maximum of six climbs, under the motto 'giving up is not an option'.
